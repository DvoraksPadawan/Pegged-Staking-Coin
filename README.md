# Pegged-Staking-Coin

This smart contract simulates Binance, enabling users to deposit tokens and earn staking rewards for their Beth (Binance's ETH-pegged token, created using another of my smart contracts). These rewards are determined by the duration users hold Beth on Binance, closely resembling the real Binance experience.

The (open source) contract is deployed here:
