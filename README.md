# Pegged-Staking-Coin

This smart contract simulates the Binance exchange, allowing users to deposit tokens and earn staking rewards for their Beth (Binance's ETH-pegged token, created using another of my smart contracts). These rewards are based on the duration users hold Beth on Binance, closely replicating the real Binance experience.

The (open source) contract is deployed here:
